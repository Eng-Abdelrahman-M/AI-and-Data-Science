## Project Overview
Applying Diffrent Clustering models. Models are (Kmeans, SOM, T-NSE and DBSCAN).

## Dataset
Pokemon Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon)

## Tasks Done
**Kmeans**
- Using the elbow rule, plot the distortion score (a.k.a inertia) vs the number of clusters.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters for k-means.

**SOM**
- Using the elbow rule, plot the distortion score (a.k.a inertia) vs the number of neurons (max 30 neurons).
- Determine the optimal number of neurons for SOM.

**DBSCAN**
- Plot the epsilon and minpoints values as x-y axes using a 3D figure to show the 10 combinations of epsilon and minpoints that brings you closer to the 10 clusters. The z-axis should illustrate the number of clusters you obtain when using the corresponding epsilon and minpoints.
- After determine the parameters for DBSCAN with 10 clusters, plot DBSCAN clusters.
