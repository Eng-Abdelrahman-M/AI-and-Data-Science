## Project overview
Understand Naïve Bayes Classification and how the mean and the variance values affect posterior probabilities.

## Dataset
**iris** dataset

## Tasks
1. Plot the likelihoods of first feature (Sepal length) for each class as given below
2. Apply Naïve Bayes Classifier to 2D Iris dataset to predict classes
3. Plot posterior probabilities and calculate the accuracy
- Change and repeat 1,2,3 Mean1 = Mean2 = Mean3 = 5.5
- Change and repeat 1,2,3 Var1 = Var2 = Var3 = 0.26
