# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and C++ Visual studio solution.

## Contents

### Machine Learning

- [Clutering Pokémon dataset](https://github.com/Eng-Abdelrahman-M/AI-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Machine%20learning/Clustering/Clutering_Pok%C3%A9mon_dataset.ipynb): Applying Diffrent Clustering models. Models are (Kmeans, SOM, T-NSE and DBSCAN).

- [Naïve Bayes Classification](https://github.com/Eng-Abdelrahman-M/AI-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20learning/Na%C3%AFve%20Bayes%20Classification): Understand Naïve Bayes Classification and how the mean and the variance values affect posterior probabilities.

- [Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/Eng-Abdelrahman-M/AI-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20learning/Multiclass%20Classification): Implement One-versus-Rest (OvR) strategy transforming multiclass classification problems to multiple binary classification problems.

- [Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)](https://github.com/Eng-Abdelrahman-M/AI-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20learning/Multi%20Layer%20Perceptron%20(MLP)): Apply Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the provided dataset by using different activation functions.

- [Decision Tree, Bagging and Boosting](https://github.com/Eng-Abdelrahman-M/AI-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20learning/Decision%20Tree%20%2B%20Bagging%20%2B%20Boosting): Train Decision tree, bagging and boosting on dumy data and plot decision boundaries. 

- [Comparing Different Algorithms](https://github.com/Eng-Abdelrahman-M/AI-and-Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20learning/Comparing%20Different%20Algorithms): Train Decision Tree, SVM and Gradiant Boost. Apply feature selection, finetuing and compare the models with stacking algorithm.
